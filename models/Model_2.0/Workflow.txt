Timeline Suggestion

Week 1: Data exploration and visualization; understand patterns in your dataset
Week 2: Data preprocessing and initial model architecture setup
Week 3-4: Model training and hyperparameter tuning
Week 5: Evaluation and refinement of model
Week 6: Development of the user interface for floor plan generation
Week 7: Testing with various input configurations and documenting results
Week 8: Final integration and project documentation
Remember to start with a simpler model and gradually increase complexity as you gain confidence in your implementation. Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part of this roadmap?
